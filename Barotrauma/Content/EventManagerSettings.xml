  <!-- DefaultEventThreshold
      Event threshold determines how low the intensity of the current situation has to be for a new random event to be created.
      The threshold may increase over time, but is reset to this default value after creating a new event. -->

  <!-- EventThresholdIncrease
      How much the event threshold increases per second. Can be used to make sure that new events will be created
      eventually even if the current crisis situation is not resolved (e.g. sub laying flooded on the ocean floor...)-->

  <!-- EventCooldown
      Minimum amount of time between creating new random events. -->
  
  <!-- FreezeDurationWhenCrewAway
      Additional events don't trigger during this time when the crew (or more specifically, more than 50% of the non-bot characters) 
      is outside the sub (exploring a wreck, cave, ruin or a beacon station). -->
