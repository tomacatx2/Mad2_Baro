    <Terminal welcomemessage="The Partizans Voice Issue 413 \n\n &#xD;&#xA;Brothers, the captain and his officers have gone TOO FAR. They do naught but oppress the humble workers of Europa. And if you TRY, just TRY to solve it diplomatically, \n&#xD;&#xA;you get beaten down by their security lapdogs. The time for diplomacy has passed. The time has come for RESISTENCE. This model of submarine has many nooks and crannies. \n&#xD;&#xA;One of which is behind the junction compartment. \n&#xD;&#xA;Brother, cut into this secret room. Inside you will find all you need to overthrow the captain and perhaps, one day, overthrow the entire coalition. The separatists will win." pickingtime="0" canbepicked="False" allowingameediting="False" msg="ItemMsgInteractSelect" />
