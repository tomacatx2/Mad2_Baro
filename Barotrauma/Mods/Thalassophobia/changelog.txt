-(Map/locationTypesCoalition)			New Coalition Outpost types added indicated by blue colors. Coalition Outposts will wage war with any non-coalition faction assuming they have interest and the might to do so. Likewise, Coalition Locations will fall to any attacking factions if they cannot defend themselves.
-(Map/locationTypesCoalition/Renegade)	Each outpost type has been split into specialization subsets that affect what they sell. Mines can specialize in radioactive materials, metals, and anomalous materials. Military outposts can specialize in normal weaponry, nuclear weaponry, and alien weaponry. These subtypes can change between one another under correct circumstances.
