General
------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This folder is the place where mods installed from the Steam Workshop go.
	You should also place your own mods in this folder, under a separate
	subfolder (e.g. "Mods/MyMod").

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Content Packages:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Content packages determine which configuration files the game will be using.
	This includes the configuration files for items, map structures, characters, 
	monsters and jobs.

	In the multiplayer mode, players are required to use the same content package
	as the server or they won't be able to join.

	All mods published in the Steam Workshop need a content package.

	If you just want to publish a custom submarine in the workshop, you
	don't need to worry about content packages - you can just select the 
	submarine from the "Publish item" tab in the Workshop menu, and the
	game automatically creates a folder and content package for your mod.

Example

	A very simple content package could be configured as follows:

	<contentpackage name="BestModEver" path="Mods/BestModEver/filelist.xml" gameversion="0.9.1.0" corepackage="true">
		<Item file="Mods/BestModEver/items.xml" />
		<Character file="Mods/BestModEver/Human/Human.xml" />
		<Character file="Mods/BestModEver/Cthulhu/cthulhu.xml" />
		<Character file="Content/Characters/Crawler/crawler.xml" />
		<Structure file="Content/Map/StructurePrefabs.xml" />
		<Jobs file="Content/Jobs.xml" />
		<RandomEvents file="Mods/BestModEver/randomevents.xml" />
		<Executable file="Barotrauma.exe" />
	</contentpackage>

	Note that this mod has been configured as a "core package". Core packages are
	packages that contain all the necessary files to make the game run, instead of
	just adding some extra files on top of another content package. There can only
	be one core package selected at a time.

	This content package would replace all the items in the game with whatever items are
	configured in the "Mods/BestModEver/items.xml" file. It would also use a modified
	version of the human characters and have all the monsters in the game replaced with
	crawlers and Cthulhus. The random events have also been changed - perhaps by adding
	a new event that spawns Cthulhu and removing the events that spawn monsters/items
	which aren't included in the mod. 

	Note that the content package should be saved with the file name "filelist.xml" in
	the Mods folder, in this case "Mods/BestModEver/filelist.xml".

Non-core content packages

	Most mods are usually not core content packages, but instead add things to or
	modify things in the Vanilla content package (= the default content of the game).

	Here's an example of a simple non-core package:

	<contentpackage name="BestModEver" path="Mods/PotatoGun/filelist.xml" gameversion="0.9.1.0" corepackage="false">
		<Item file="Mods/PotatoGun/potatogun.xml" />
	</contentpackage>

	This mod would simply add an extra item to the game (or items if there are multiple 
	ones configured	in the potatogun.xml file).

Overriding content

	You can also set your mods to override vanilla content without having to modify the
	Vanilla content package. This can be done by using Override-elements in the xml
	configuration files. For example, the content of the potatogun.xml file could be
	something like this:

	<Override>
		<Item name="Potato Gun" identifier="harpoongun">
			...
		</Item>
	</Override>

	This would mean that the item overrides an item that has the identifier "harpoongun",
	i.e. replaces harpoon guns with the potato gun.
